# Drowsiness_Detection
Drowsiness Detection (Brain and Cognitive Society,IIT-Kanpur) (May’24–Jul’24)
Objective • To develop an interpretable and efficient CNN model for driver drowsiness detection using EEG signals.
          • Designed for real-time use, ensuring cross-subject generalization without subject-specific calibration.
Approach  • Implemented a lightweight CNN with separable convolutions for comprehensive EEG feature extraction.
          •Applied CAM-based interpretation techniques to visualize key neural patterns influencing predictions.
Impact    • Designed an interpretable CNN validated via LOSO, achieving 70.80% accuracy with clear EEG heatmaps.
          •Enhanced interpretability by identifying meaningful EEG features relevant to drowsiness and alertness.
